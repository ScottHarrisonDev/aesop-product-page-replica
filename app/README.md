# Aesop Replica Page App

This is a VueJS app (built with NuxtJS) that displays an Aesop product in a page that is built to replicate the UI and functionality of the Aesop web page.

## Install
1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Open a terminal at the project root and run `yarn install`, this will install all the dependencies for the project.
3. From the project root run `yarn dev` to start the server. You should see a message to say 'Compiled successfully' and if you navigate to http://localhost:3000 you should see the web app. Ensure that the Node.js server is running and you will then be able to see the website. You are now ready to develop locally.

2. Run `yarn install` from the app directory, this will install all the dependencies for the project.
3. Run `yarn generate` from the project root, this will build the application for a static production environment.
